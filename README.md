BRML Toolbox
======

BRML is short for Bayesian Leaning and Machine Learning.

Thanks to Dr. David Barber's book Bayesian Learning and Machine Learning and his original design of the toolbox as an accompanying code for the book.

Here is the motivation:
	The BRMLtoolbox is provided to help readers see how mathematical models translate into actual MAT-
	LAB code. There are a large number of demos that a lecturer may wish to use or adapt to help illustrate
	the material. In addition many of the exercises make use of the code, helping the reader gain confidence
	in the concepts and their application. Along with complete routines for many Machine Learning methods,
	the philosophy is to provide low level routines whose composition intuitively follows the mathematical description
	of the algorithm. In this way students may easily match the mathematics with the corresponding
	algorithmic implementation.
